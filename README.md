# STM32-DSHOT

This is a simple, header-only Arduino library for library for DSHOT protocol
on STM32 microcontrollers.  I adapted it from the driver code the driver code in
[example](https://github.com/simondlevy/DshotSTM32/blob/main/examples/F405/F405.ino).
It currently does not support DSHOT telemetry.
